    - Name and description
    - Category indicator (color-coded)
    - Icon representing its function
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Tools">
    Click on tools to select them for your assistant. Consider which tools align with your assistant's purpose.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Tools">
    Some tools may require configuration:

## Tool Selection Best Practices

Consider these best practices when selecting tools for your assistants:

1. **Purpose Alignment**: Choose tools that directly support your assistant's core purpose
2. **Minimize Complexity**: Avoid adding unnecessary tools that may confuse the assistant
3. **Consider Cost**: Some tools make API calls that incur usage costs
4. **Balance Capabilities**: Combine complementary tools for enhanced functionality
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify that selected tools work well together

## Tool Limitations and Considerations

When working with tools, be aware of these limitations:

- **Rate Limits**: Tools have defined rate limits to prevent abuse
- **API Dependencies**: External services used by tools may have their own limitations
- **Authentication**: Some tools require specific API keys or permissions
- **Cost Factors**: Certain tools may have usage costs associated with them
- **Execution Time**: Complex tools may take longer to execute

## Recommended Tool Combinations

These tool combinations work well for specific assistant types:

## Customizing Tool Behavior

While you cannot modify the core functionality of built-in tools, you can influence how they're used through your assistant's system prompt:

<Tip>
  Add tool-specific instructions to your system prompt to guide how the assistant should use particular tools. For example:
  
  "When using the Web Search tool, always verify information from multiple sources and cite your references."
  
  "For image generation tools, start with low-detail descriptions and iteratively refine based on generated results."
</Tip>
