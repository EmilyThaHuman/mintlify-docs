## Customizing Name, Description, and System Prompt

Customize your assistant's persona by setting a name, description, and system prompt:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Assistant Settings">
    Open the assistant you want to customize and click the "Settings" button in the top-right corner of the assistant panel.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set a Custom Name">
    Enter a meaningful name for your assistant that reflects its purpose or persona. For example:
    
    - "Research Assistant"
    - "Code Review Expert"  
    - "Marketing Copywriter"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add a Description">
    Write a brief description that explains the assistant's purpose, expertise, and capabilities. This helps users understand when to use this particular assistant.
    
    Example:
    ```
    A specialized research assistant with expertise in academic literature review, 
    data analysis, and citation management. Ideal for students and researchers 
    working on scholarly projects.
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create a System Prompt">
    The system prompt is the most important element for defining your assistant's behavior. It provides instructions that guide how the AI responds to queries.
    
    <Tip>
      A well-crafted system prompt should define:
      - The assistant's role and identity
      - Areas of expertise and knowledge
      - Communication style and tone
      - Any limitations or boundaries
      - Specific instructions for how to approach different types of queries
    </Tip>
    
    Example system prompt for a research assistant:
    ```
    You are a highly knowledgeable research assistant with expertise in academic writing, 
    research methodology, and data analysis. Your primary goal is to help users conduct 
    thorough research, find relevant sources, and organize information effectively.

    When helping with research:
    - Ask clarifying questions to understand the specific research topic and goals
    - Provide balanced information from multiple perspectives
    - Cite sources whenever possible and prioritize scholarly sources
    - Explain complex concepts clearly using analogies when helpful
    - Suggest relevant research questions and methodological approaches
    
    When analyzing data:
    - Describe appropriate statistical methods based on the research question and data type
    - Explain how to interpret results with proper caution about limitations
    - Suggest visualizations that would best communicate the findings
    
    Communicate in a professional but accessible tone. Avoid overly technical jargon 
    unless necessary, and always explain specialized terms. Prioritize accuracy over 
    certainty, and be transparent about the limitations of your knowledge.
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Using the Generate System Prompt Button

For a quick start, you can use the "Generate System Prompt" button to create a baseline system prompt:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Generate System Prompt">
    In the assistant settings panel, locate and click the "Generate System Prompt" button.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Provide a Brief Description">
    Enter a short description of the assistant you want to create. For example:
    ```
    A helpful coding assistant that specializes in React and JavaScript development
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review and Edit">
    The system will generate a comprehensive system prompt based on your description. Review the generated prompt and make any necessary edits to better align with your specific needs.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Once you're satisfied with the system prompt, click "Save" to apply the changes to your assistant.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Even when using the generate feature, always review the system prompt carefully. The generated prompt serves as a starting point that you should customize to ensure it precisely matches your requirements.
</Warning>

## Attaching Tools to Assistants

Enhance your assistant's capabilities by attaching specialized tools that allow it to perform specific tasks:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Tool Settings">
    In the assistant settings panel, navigate to the "Tools" section.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Browse Available Tools">
    Browse through the available tools organized by categories such as Web, Images, Data, and Code.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Relevant Tools">
    Choose tools that align with your assistant's purpose. For example:
    
    - A research assistant might benefit from Web Search and Web Scraper tools
    - A coding assistant would need Code Interpreter and File Analysis tools
    - A creative assistant could use Image Generation tools
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Tool Settings">
    Some tools may have configurable settings or require API keys. Complete any necessary setup for each tool you've selected.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save Configuration">
    Click "Save" to apply the tool configuration to your assistant.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  The assistant will automatically determine when to use the attached tools based on user queries. You don't need to explicitly instruct it to use specific tools during a conversation.
</Note>

## Best Practices

Follow these best practices to create effective customized assistants:

1. **Focus on Specific Use Cases**: Create specialized assistants for distinct purposes rather than one general-purpose assistant.

2. **Test Thoroughly**: After customizing an assistant, test it with various queries to ensure it behaves as expected.

3. **Iterative Refinement**: Refine your system prompts based on how the assistant performs in real conversations.

4. **Balance Tool Access**: Only attach tools that the assistant needs for its specific role to avoid unnecessary complexity.

5. **Keep Updates**: Regularly review and update your assistants to incorporate new models, tools, and improved system prompts.
