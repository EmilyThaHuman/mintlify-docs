## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: The more specific your request, the more targeted and useful the leads will be. Include industry, location, company size, or other relevant criteria.

2. **Review and Refine**: Examine initial results and refine your queries to narrow down to the most promising leads.

3. **Multi-Step Approach**: For comprehensive research, use a multi-step approach - first identifying potential leads, then requesting deeper information on the most promising ones.

4. **Verify Information**: Always verify critical contact information before using it in campaigns, as web-scraped data may occasionally be outdated.

5. **Export Strategy**: Choose the right export format for your workflow - CSVs for CRM imports, PDFs for executive summaries or visual reports.
