## Example Use Cases

### Academic Research

Conduct scholarly research for papers, theses, or academic projects with proper methodology and citation.

<Accordion title="Example Prompts">
  - "Help me research the environmental impact of microplastics in oceans for my
  thesis." - "Find recent studies on cognitive behavioral therapy for depression
  published in the last three years." - "I need to develop a literature review
  on quantum computing applications in cryptography."
</Accordion>

<Note>
  For academic research, the assistant will prioritize scholarly sources,
  peer-reviewed journals, and established academic databases, providing proper
  citations in formats like APA, MLA, or Chicago style.
</Note>

### Market Analysis

Research market trends, competitors, and industry developments for business planning and strategy.

<Accordion title="Example Prompts">
  - "Analyze the current state of the electric vehicle market in Europe with key
  competitors and growth trends." - "Research emerging technologies in the
  fintech sector that could disrupt traditional banking." - "Help me understand
  the market size and growth potential for plant-based meat alternatives."
</Accordion>

<Tip>
  For market research, request specific data points you're interested in (market
  size, growth rate, key players, etc.) to get more targeted results. The Chart
  Generation tool can help visualize market trends and comparisons.
</Tip>

### Information Synthesis

Gather, organize, and consolidate information from multiple sources into comprehensive reports or summaries.

<Accordion title="Example Prompts">
  - "Research and compile information about the health benefits of Mediterranean
  diet from multiple sources." - "Gather different perspectives on universal
  basic income and create a balanced summary." - "Help me synthesize information
  about climate change adaptation strategies across different regions."
</Accordion>

<Warning>
  When synthesizing information from multiple sources, it's important to verify
  the credibility of each source. Ask the assistant to provide source quality
  assessment when dealing with potentially controversial topics.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Define your research question clearly and specify the scope, depth, and type of information you need.

2. **Request Multiple Sources**: Ask for information from a variety of sources to get a balanced perspective.

3. **Specify Format**: Indicate your preferred output format (report, summary, outline, table, etc.) for better organization.

4. **Ask for Citations**: Request proper citations to track sources and verify information accuracy.

5. **Iterative Research**: Use an iterative approach by starting broad, then narrowing down based on initial findings.
